    <h1>Some of my friends</h1>
    <p>
      When I first came to Saigon, I met a lot of people and made many friends. But some of them are <b>special</b>.<br>
      Here, I will introduce a few of them to anyone who can access this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Here are 5 of my niggas:</h2>

            Thanh is from Thanh Hoa, around 1,323 km away. It's in the central region, which often suffers from storms and floods.
            I'm grateful to have met him.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thanh knows something about everything—science, history, music, or random facts. He also does <b>mewing</b> sometimes, which is kind of cute.

            Khoa was always with me during courses from CSI106 to PRF192. He has a good personality and is a trustworthy friend.

          <li title="Just joking, I'm not gay">
            Though he has a bad habit (smoking), he's still a good person. Once, he jokingly said:<br>
            “Life is short, let’s have fun.”<br>
